# AML.T0049: Exploit Public-Facing Application

Adversaries may attempt to take advantage of a weakness in an Internet-facing computer or program using software, data, or commands in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior. The weakness in the system can be a bug, a glitch, or a design vulnerability. These applications are often websites, but can include databases (like SQL), standard services (like SMB or SSH), network device administration and management protocols (like SNMP and Smart Install), and any other applications with Internet accessible open sockets, such as web servers and related services.

## Metadata

- **Technique ID:** AML.T0049
- **Created:** February 28, 2023
- **Last Modified:** February 28, 2023
- **Maturity:** realized
- **MITRE ATT&CK Reference:** [T1190](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190/)

## Tactics (1)

This technique supports the following tactics:

- 

## Case Studies (3)

The following case studies demonstrate this technique:

### [[atlas/case-studies/shadowray|AML.CS0023: ShadowRay]]

Once open Ray clusters have been identified, adversaries could use the Jobs API to invoke jobs onto accessible clusters. The Jobs API does not support any kind of authorization, so anyone with network access to the cluster can execute arbitrary code remotely.

### [[atlas/case-studies/ai-model-tampering-via-supply-chain-attack|AML.CS0028: AI Model Tampering via Supply Chain Attack]]

The researchers were able to exploit the misconfigured registries to pull container images without requiring authentication. In total, researchers pulled several terabytes of data containing over 20,000 images.

### [[atlas/case-studies/llm-jacking|AML.CS0030: LLM Jacking]]

The adversaries exploited a vulnerable version of Laravel ([CVE-2021-3129](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-3129)) to gain initial access to the victims' systems.
