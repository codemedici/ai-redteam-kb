# Global AI Governance & Coordination

## Summary

As AI technologies (especially GenAI) become deeply embedded in critical infrastructure worldwide, the necessity for **international coordination** in AI governance mirrors the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in nuclear oversight. Current AI regulation is fragmented across nations, creating an "AI divide," inconsistent safety standards, and gaps in misuse prevention. An IAEA-like coordinating body for AI would: (1) establish **global safety and ethics standards**, (2) facilitate **knowledge and technology transfer** to address disparities, (3) provide **regulatory oversight and compliance monitoring**, and (4) foster **consensus on contentious issues** (e.g., AI in warfare, surveillance). Key challenges include tensions between national sovereignty and collective goals, diverse cultural/ethical norms, enforcement across jurisdictions, and keeping pace with rapid AI advancement.

## The IAEA Model for AI

### IAEA's Core Functions (Applied to AI Context)

1. **Regulatory Body**  
   - Established safety and security measures for nuclear technology (1957)  
   - AI parallel: Enforce global AI safety standards, audit compliance (similar to IAEA inspections)

2. **Forum for Scientific & Technical Cooperation**  
   - Facilitates knowledge sharing across nations  
   - AI parallel: Exchange AI best practices, avoid knowledge gaps between countries

3. **Technology & Skill Transfer**  
   - Even resource distribution, level playing field  
   - AI parallel: Ensure GenAI benefits are accessible globally, reduce "AI divide"

4. **Compliance & Dispute Resolution**  
   - Monitors adherence to agreed-upon principles  
   - AI parallel: Adjudicate AI misuse disputes, enforce transparency requirements

> "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established as an autonomous organization on July 29, 1957, with the goal of promoting the peaceful use of atomic energy, averting its use for any military purpose, and ensuring the safety and security of its application."

## Roles of an International AI Coordinating Body

### 1. Global Safety Standards

**Scope**: Define universally accepted standards covering:
- Privacy, fairness, transparency, accountability
- Safety testing protocols (analogous to nuclear facility inspections)
- Risk assessment frameworks (see [[frameworks/ai-threat-modeling]])

**Example**: November 27, 2023 non-binding agreement (USA, UK, + 16 countries) on "secure by design" AI systems — monitoring for abuse, data tampering protection, supplier vetting (Satter & Bartz, 2023). Signatories: Australia, Canada, Chile, Czechia, Estonia, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Poland, Republic of Korea, Singapore, United States, United Kingdom.

> "The agreement emphasizes the need for AI systems to be 'secure by design,' aiming to keep customers and the wider public safe from potential misuse."

### 2. Addressing Global Disparities

**Problem**: AI development concentrated in handful of nations/corporations → "AI divide" exacerbates inequities.

**Solution**:  
- Capacity-building programs for developing nations  
- Open-source model governance (balance transparency with safety)  
- Technology transfer frameworks (cf. IAEA's nuclear tech sharing)

> "Currently, AI development is led by a handful of powerful nations and corporations, which potentially leads to a concentration of AI benefits and influence among these entities. This inequity could exacerbate existing global disparities, leading to what I will call an 'AI divide.'"
>

### 3. Mitigating AI Misuse

**Threat Landscape**:  
- Deepfakes, automated surveillance, weaponized AI  
- See: [[attacks/prompt-injection]], [[attacks/jailbreak-policy-bypass]], [[case-studies/]]

**Governance Mechanisms**:  
- Global norms against malicious uses (e.g., ban on unrestricted facial recognition)  
- Enforcement penalties for non-compliance  
- Early warning systems for emerging threats

> "From the proliferation of deepfakes to automated surveillance systems, the implications of AI misuse are vast and alarming. An international coordinating body, much like the IAEA for nuclear technology, could help mitigate this risk by establishing and enforcing global norms and regulations to prevent misuse."
> 
> Source: [[sources/bibliography#Generative AI Security]], p. 66

### 4. Keeping Pace with Technological Advancement

**Challenge**: AI progress outpaces policy/regulatory development → regulatory vacuum.

**Strategy**:  
- Rapid periodic updates to international agreements  
- Continuous stakeholder engagement (researchers, policymakers, civil society)  
- Collaborative research initiatives (e.g., AI for climate change, pandemics)  
- Role for UN, OECD in organizing regular coordination meetings

> "The rapid advancement of AI technology often outpaces the corresponding policy and regulatory developments. As a result, many AI applications operate in a regulatory vacuum, leaving them unmonitored and potentially dangerous."

## Key Challenges & Mitigation Strategies

### 1. National Sovereignty vs. Collective Goals

**Tension**: Nations reluctant to share proprietary AI knowledge or adhere to norms conflicting with national interests.

**Mitigation**:  
- Demonstrate **mutual benefits** (e.g., joint research on transnational crises)  
- Open communication channels to build trust  
- Costly signaling to convey intentions (CSET Georgetown research: "Decoding Intentions" — use policy actions that carry risk if withdrawn) (Imbrie et al., 2023)

> "One possible avenue to mitigate this challenge is through the cultivation of mutual benefits and trust. Open communication channels could be developed to demonstrate how participating in a globally coordinated AI framework can bolster national AI capabilities."
> 
> Source: [[sources/bibliography#Generative AI Security]], p. 67-68

---

### 2. Commercial Entity Resistance

**Problem**: Companies reluctant to share proprietary tech or comply with regulations reducing competitive advantage.

**Strategy**:  
- Establish **ISO-like international AI safety standards** (maintain baseline, allow competitive differentiation)  
- Industry consortia co-define standards (ensure rigor + practicality)  
- Incentivize compliance (market access, certification benefits)

> "One effective strategy to counter this resistance might involve the establishment of international AI safety and ethics standards, akin to ISO standards in other domains."
> 
> Source: [[sources/bibliography#Generative AI Security]], p. 68

---

### 3. Diverse Cultural & Ethical Norms

**Challenge**: Global societies have divergent ethical interpretations.

**Approach**:  
- **Participatory decision-making** (representatives from diverse cultures)  
- International symposia, online platforms for dialogue  
- Evolve toward broadly acceptable consensus (not universal satisfaction)

> "Societies around the world have their own unique interpretations of ethical principles, and integrating these disparate views into a universally accepted framework is a Herculean task."
> 
> Source: [[sources/bibliography#Generative AI Security]], p. 69

---

### 4. Enforcement & Compliance

**Obstacles**: Heterogeneous regulatory capacities across countries.

**Solutions**:  
- Robust **international monitoring mechanism** (cf. IAEA inspections)  
- Incentives for compliance + penalties for violations (e.g., EU AI Act: up to €40M or 7% global revenue)  
- Collaborate with national regulatory bodies for seamless enforcement

> "A viable strategy to navigate this hurdle could be the creation of a robust international monitoring and enforcement mechanism. This could be augmented by incentives for compliance and punitive measures for non-compliance."
> 
> Source: [[sources/bibliography#Generative AI Security]], p. 69

---

### 5. Decoding National Intentions

**Issue**: Difficulty conveying national AI policies on global stage.

**Research**: CSET Georgetown paper "Decoding Intentions" (Imbrie et al., 2023) explores **costly signals** (actions carrying risk if withdrawn) to reduce misunderstandings.

**Tension**: Transparency vs. privacy/security in AI development.

> "The paper discusses companies, countries, and policymakers demonstrating what they'd like to do with artificial intelligence through things like policy decisions and product releases... 'costly signals' are actions or statements that carry a risk for the sender if withdrawn."
>

## Foundation Models vs. Applications: Regulatory Dilemma

### The Debate

**Option A: Regulate Foundation Models Directly**  
- Comprehensive framework: risk management, data practices, documentation, accuracy, cybersecurity  
- **Pros**: Sets secure foundation for downstream developers  
- **Cons**: May stifle innovation (esp. open-source), unintended competitive consequences

**Option B: Regulate Applications Only**  
- Responsibility on downstream developers  
- **Pros**: Avoids limiting creative potential of base models  
- **Cons**: Inconsistent safety across applications, harder to trace harms to root cause

### Emerging Balanced Approach

**Differentiated Regulation**:  
- **Closed/Commercial Models** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google): Direct regulation (due to opacity, commercial incentives)  
- **Open-Source Models**: Encourage transparency, lighter-touch governance  
- **All Applications**: Proportional oversight based on risk (see [[frameworks/owasp-top10-llm-2025-evolution]])

**Case Study**: EU AI Act regulates foundation models (risk management, data governance, technical docs, accuracy, cybersecurity). US lacks direct foundation model regulation → EU developers must invest more in validating security controls for GPT-4/Claude-based apps.
