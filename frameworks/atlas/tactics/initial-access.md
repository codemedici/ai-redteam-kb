# AML.TA0004: Initial Access

The adversary is trying to gain access to the AI system.

The target system could be a network, mobile device, or an edge device such as a sensor platform.
The AI capabilities used by the system could be local with onboard or cloud-enabled AI capabilities.

Initial Access consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their initial foothold within the system.
