# AML.TA0002: Reconnaissance

The adversary is trying to gather information about the AI system they can use to plan future operations.

Reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting.
Such information may include details of the victim organizations' AI capabilities and research efforts.
This information can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to obtain relevant AI artifacts, targeting AI capabilities used by the victim, tailoring attacks to the particular models used by the victim, or to drive and lead further Reconnaissance efforts.
