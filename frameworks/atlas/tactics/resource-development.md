# AML.TA0003: Resource Development

The adversary is trying to establish resources they can use to support operations.

Resource Development consists of techniques that involve adversaries creating,
purchasing, or compromising/stealing resources that can be used to support targeting.
Such resources include AI artifacts, infrastructure, accounts, or capabilities.
These resources can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as [AI Attack Staging](/tactics/AML.TA0001).
