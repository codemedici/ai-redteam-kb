# AML.T0007: Discover AI Artifacts

Adversaries may search private sources to identify AI learning artifacts that exist on the system and gather information about them.
These artifacts can include the software stack used to train and deploy models, training and testing data management systems, container registries, software repositories, and model zoos.

This information can be used to identify targets for further collection, exfiltration, or disruption, and to tailor and improve attacks.
