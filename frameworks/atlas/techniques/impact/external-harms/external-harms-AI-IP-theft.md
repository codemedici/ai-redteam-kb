# AML.T0048.004: AI Intellectual Property Theft

Adversaries may exfiltrate AI artifacts to steal intellectual property and cause economic harm to the victim organization.

Proprietary training data is costly to collect and annotate and may be a target for [Exfiltration](/tactics/AML.TA0010) and theft.

AIaaS providers charge for use of their API.
An adversary who has stolen a model via [Exfiltration](/tactics/AML.TA0010) or via [Extract AI Model](/techniques/AML.T0024.002) now has unlimited use of that service without paying the owner of the intellectual property.
