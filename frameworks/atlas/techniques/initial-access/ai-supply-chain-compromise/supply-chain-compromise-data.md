# AML.T0010.002: Data

Data is a key vector of supply chain compromise for adversaries.
Every AI project will require some form of data.
Many rely on large open source datasets that are publicly available.
An adversary could rely on compromising these sources of data.
The malicious data could be a result of [[frameworks/atlas/techniques/resource-development/poison-training-data|Poison Training Data]] or include traditional malware.

An adversary can also target private datasets in the labeling phase.
The creation of private datasets will often require the hiring of outside labeling services.
An adversary can poison a dataset by modifying the labels being generated by the labeling service.

The actor uploaded "mutant" samples to the platform.

### [[frameworks/atlas/case-studies/tay-poisoning|AML.CS0009: Tay Poisoning]]

Tay bot used the interactions with its Twitter users as training data to improve its conversations.
Adversaries were able to coordinate with the intent of defacing Tay bot by exploiting this feedback loop.
