# AML.T0018.002: Embed Malware

> **Sub-Technique of:** [[frameworks/atlas/techniques/persistence/manipulate-ai-model/manipulate-ai-model-overview|AML.T0018: Manipulate AI Model]]

Adversaries may embed malicious code into AI Model files.
AI models may be packaged as a combination of instructions and weights.
Some formats such as pickle files are unsafe to deserialize because they can contain unsafe calls such as exec.
Models with embedded malware may still operate as expected.
It may allow them to achieve Execution, Command & Control, or Exfiltrate Data.

## Case Studies (2)

The following case studies demonstrate this technique:

### [[frameworks/atlas/case-studies/organization-confusion-on-hugging-face|AML.CS0027: Organization Confusion on Hugging Face]]

The researcher embedded [Sliver](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver), an open source C2 server, into the target model. They added a `Lambda` layer to the model, which allows for arbitrary code to be run, and used an `exec()` call to execute the Sliver payload.

### [[frameworks/atlas/case-studies/malicious-models-on-hugging-face|AML.CS0031: Malicious Models on Hugging Face]]

The adversary embedded malware into an AI model stored in a pickle file. The malware was designed to execute when the model is loaded by a user.

ReversingLabs found two instances of this on Hugging Face during their research.
