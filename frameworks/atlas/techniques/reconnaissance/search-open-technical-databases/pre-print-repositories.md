# AML.T0000.001: Pre-Print Repositories

> **Sub-Technique of:** [[frameworks/atlas/techniques/reconnaissance/search-open-technical-databases/search-open-technical-databases|AML.T0000: Search Open Technical Databases]]

Pre-Print repositories, such as arXiv, contain the latest academic research papers that haven't been peer reviewed.
They may contain research notes, or technical reports that aren't typically published in journals or conference proceedings.
Pre-print repositories also serve as a central location to share papers that have been accepted to journals.
Searching pre-print repositories  provide adversaries with a relatively up-to-date view of what researchers in the victim organization are working on.

We identified a machine learning based approach to malicious URL detection as a representative approach and potential target from the paper [URLNet: Learning a URL representation with deep learning for malicious URL detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03162), which was found on arXiv (a pre-print repository).
