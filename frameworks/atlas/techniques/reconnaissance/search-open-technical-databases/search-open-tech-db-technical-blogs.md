# AML.T0000.002: Technical Blogs

Research labs at academic institutions and company R&D divisions often have blogs that highlight their use of artificial intelligence and its application to the organization's unique problems.
Individual researchers also frequently document their work in blogposts.
An adversary may search for posts made by the target victim organization or its employees.
In comparison to [Journals and Conference Proceedings](/techniques/AML.T0000.000) and [Pre-Print Repositories](/techniques/AML.T0000.001) this material will often contain more practical aspects of the AI system.
This could include underlying technologies and frameworks used, and possibly some information about the API access and use case.
This will help the adversary better understand how that organization is using AI internally and the details of their approach that could aid in tailoring an attack.
