# AML.T0003: Search Victim-Owned Websites

Adversaries may search websites owned by the victim for information that can be used during targeting.
Victim-owned websites may contain technical details about their AI-enabled products or services.
Victim-owned websites may contain a variety of details, including names of departments/divisions, physical locations, and data about key employees such as names, roles, and contact info.
These sites may also have details highlighting business operations and relationships.

Adversaries may search victim-owned websites to gather actionable information.
This information may help adversaries tailor their attacks (e.g. [Adversarial AI Attacks](/techniques/AML.T0017.000) or [Manual Modification](/techniques/AML.T0043.003)).
Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (e.g. [Search Open Technical Databases](/techniques/AML.T0000) or [Search Open AI Vulnerability Analysis](/techniques/AML.T0001))
