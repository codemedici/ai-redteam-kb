# AML.T0008.000: AI Development Workspaces

Developing and staging AI attacks often requires expensive compute resources.
Adversaries may need access to one or many GPUs in order to develop an attack.
They may try to anonymously use free resources such as Google Colaboratory, or cloud resources such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud as an efficient way to stand up temporary resources to conduct operations.
Multiple workspaces may be used to avoid detection.
