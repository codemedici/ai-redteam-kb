# AML.T0017.000: Adversarial AI Attacks

Adversaries may develop their own adversarial attacks.
They may leverage existing libraries as a starting point ([Adversarial AI Attack Implementations](/techniques/AML.T0016.000)).
They may implement ideas described in public research papers or develop custom made attacks for the victim model.
