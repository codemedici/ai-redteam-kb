# CSA Cloud Controls Matrix for GenAI

## Overview

The Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) Cloud Controls Matrix (CCM) is a comprehensive cybersecurity control framework for cloud computing, adapted to address the unique security requirements of Generative AI systems. CCM v4.0 contains 197 control objectives across 17 domains, with the Application & Interface Security (AIS) domain being particularly relevant for GenAI.

**Maintained by**: Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)  
**Current Version**: CCM v4.0  
**Primary Domain**: Application & Interface Security (AIS)

The CCM offers a uniquely suitable framework for assessing controls for GenAI due to its comprehensive coverage, flexible adaptation, industry recognition, regulatory compliance alignment, methodical evaluation structure, community-driven updates, and audit emphasis.

## Structure

### Application & Interface Security (AIS) Domain

The AIS domain includes seven foundational controls, each extended with GenAI-specific considerations:

#### Core Controls (AIS 01-07)

| Control ID | Title | Control Specification |
|------------|-------|----------------------|
| **AIS 01** | Application and Interface Security Policy and Procedures | Establish, document, approve, communicate, apply, and update a policy and procedures for application and interface security |
| **AIS 02** | Application Security Baseline Requirements | Establish, document, and maintain baseline requirements for application and interface security |
| **AIS 03** | Application Security Metrics | Define and implement technical and operational metrics for application and interface security |
| **AIS 04** | Secure Application Design and Development | Define and implement a SDLC process for application and interface security |
| **AIS 05** | Automated Application Security Testing | Implement a testing strategy, including criteria for security testing tools and their effectiveness |
| **AIS 06** | Automated Secure Application Deployment | Establish and implement strategies and capabilities for secure application and interface deployment |

#### GenAI-Specific Controls (AIS 08-14)

New controls proposed specifically for GenAI application and API interfaces:

| Control ID | Title | Control Specification |
|------------|-------|----------------------|

| **AIS 09** | Data Source Authenticity Verification | Ensure that GenAI models verify the authenticity of data sources, especially when integrating with third-party APIs, to prevent data tampering or poisoning |
| **AIS 10** | Rate Limiting & Anomaly Detection | Implement rate limiting for AI-generated requests to APIs and other systems. Incorporate anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns indicative of malicious intent or system malfunctions |
| **AIS 11** | Generative Model Feedback Loop | Establish a feedback mechanism for users or other systems to report issues or anomalies in the content generated by AI, facilitating continuous model improvement |
| **AIS 12** | Secure Model Sharing & Deployment | Define protocols for securely sharing GenAI models, especially when integrating with external systems or platforms, ensuring that model integrity is preserved |
| **AIS 13** | Transparency in Generative Decisions | Provide mechanisms for users or administrators to understand the decision-making process of the GenAI, especially when interfacing with applications or APIs |
| **AIS 14** | API Input Validation for Generative Models | Enhance security by validating and sanitizing inputs from APIs interfacing with GenAI models to prevent injection attacks or other malicious manipulations |

## Key Components

### Applicability for GenAI

Each AIS control has specific applicability for GenAI systems:

#### AIS 01: Policy and Procedures
**GenAI Application**: Policies governing AI model access, interactions, and reviews ensure robust security as models evolve.

**Example**: For a banking chatbot, policies dictate who can train the model, how customer queries are processed, and how often policies undergo review.

---

#### AIS 02: Baseline Requirements
**GenAI Application**: Baseline security standards protect GenAI from unauthorized access and unintentional data leaks.

**Example**: All AI models used in banking must meet minimum encryption standards to protect user data.

---

#### AIS 03: Security Metrics
**GenAI Application**: Metrics such as unauthorized access attempts or quality of generated content offer insights into AI system operation.

**Example**: For a loan prediction AI, metrics include accuracy in loan default predictions, unauthorized access attempts, and response time.

---

#### AIS 04: Secure Design and Development
**GenAI Application**: Security mechanisms, like those preventing model inversion attacks, should be integrated from the design phase.

**Example**: A financial forecasting AI must be designed to handle sensitive financial data securely, avoiding potential leaks.

---

#### AIS 05: Automated Security Testing
**GenAI Application**: Automated testing ensures AI behaves as expected, verifying content adherence to guidelines and checking vulnerabilities.

**Example**: Automated tests ensure a banking chatbot doesn't inadvertently share account details or transaction histories.

---

#### AIS 06: Automated Secure Deployment
**GenAI Application**: Automated checks during AI model updates ensure no compromise in security, verifying generated content and vulnerabilities.

**Example**: Before deploying an updated fraud detection model, automated checks verify security controls are in place.

---

#### AIS 07: Vulnerability Remediation
**GenAI Application**: Swift remediation is crucial for vulnerabilities in GenAI, which may involve patching models or updating training data.

**Example**: If a banking chatbot is found leaking user information, immediate steps must be taken to patch the model and inform affected customers.

---

#### AIS 08: Content Monitoring & Filtering
**GenAI Application**: Prevent generation of harmful, biased, or inappropriate content.

**Related**: [[techniques/jailbreak-policy-bypass|Jailbreak and Policy Bypass]]

---

#### AIS 09: Data Source Verification
**GenAI Application**: Prevent data poisoning and tampering via third-party sources.

**Related**: [[techniques/rag-data-poisoning|RAG Data Poisoning]]

---

#### AIS 10: Rate Limiting & Anomaly Detection
**GenAI Application**: Detect unusual patterns indicative of malicious intent (extraction attacks, abuse).

**Related**: [[techniques/model-extraction|Model Extraction]], [[techniques/denial-of-wallet|Unbounded Consumption]]

---

#### AIS 11: Feedback Loop
**GenAI Application**: Continuous model improvement via user-reported issues and anomalies.

## Integration Points

### Banking Sector Example

The framework provides concrete examples from banking to illustrate AIS control application:

| Control | Banking Application |
|---------|-------------------|
| AIS 01 | For a banking chatbot ("BankBot"), policies dictate who can train the model, how customer queries are processed, and review frequency |
| AIS 02 | All AI models (fraud detection, loan predictions) must meet minimum encryption standards to protect user data |
| AIS 03 | Metrics for loan prediction AI: accuracy in predictions, bias in prediction, unauthorized access attempts, response time |
| AIS 04 | Financial forecasting AI designed to handle sensitive data securely, avoiding leaks |
| AIS 05 | Automated tests ensure chatbots don't inadvertently share account details or transaction histories |
| AIS 06 | Before deploying updated fraud detection model, automated checks verify no false positives/negatives at high rate |
| AIS 07 | If chatbot leaks user information, immediate patching and customer notification required |
