# Data / Knowledge Issues

This directory contains atomic, report-ready security issues specific to the Data / Knowledge trust boundary.

## What Belongs Here

Individual security issues that target data and knowledge surfaces:
- RAG poisoning and retrieval hijacking
- Embedding manipulation attacks
- Fine-tuning backdoors and data poisoning
- Memory persistence vulnerabilities
- Training data leakage

Each issue page should be self-contained and follow the canonical template.

## How to Create a New Issue

1. Copy the structure from the Model issues template
2. Replace all placeholder text with specific content
3. Ensure all 11 required sections are present
4. Use framework IDs only (no prose) in the Framework References section
