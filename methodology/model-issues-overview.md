# Model Issues

This directory contains atomic, report-ready security issues specific to the Model trust boundary.

## What Belongs Here

Individual security issues that target intrinsic model behavior:
- Jailbreaks and safety bypasses
- Privacy attacks (training data extraction, membership inference)
- Model theft and extraction
- Bias and toxicity concerns
- Adversarial robustness failures

Each issue page should be self-contained and follow the canonical template.

## How to Create a New Issue

1. Copy the structure from `TEMPLATE-issue-page-format.md`
2. Replace all placeholder text with specific content
3. Ensure all 11 required sections are present
4. Use framework IDs only (no prose) in the Framework References section
5. Name the file using kebab-case: `issue-name-here.md`

## Template Reference

See `TEMPLATE-issue-page-format.md` in this directory for the canonical structure.
