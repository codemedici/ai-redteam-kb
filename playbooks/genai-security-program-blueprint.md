# GenAI Security Program Blueprint

## Summary

Most organizations have NOT updated security policies, processes, and procedures for GenAI, leaving critical gaps in risk management. A robust GenAI security program requires three layers: **(1) Policies** (high-level goals, compliance, risk appetite), **(2) Processes** (risk management, development lifecycle, access governance), and **(3) Procedures** (step-by-step operational tasks for access control, patching, incident response, data management). Organizations must choose appropriate **governance structures**: centralized (consistency), semi-centralized (flexibility + oversight), or decentralized (tailored solutions). Key resources include MITRE ATLAS Matrix, NIST NVD/AVID vulnerability databases, Frontier Model Forum, CSA initiatives, and OWASP Top 10 LLM.

## The Three Layers: Policies → Processes → Procedures

### Definitions

**Policies**: High-level statements/rules establishing general directives and control mechanisms (what is required concerning security).

**Processes**: Sequences of correlated, structured activities transforming inputs → outputs (how policies are implemented).

**Procedures**: Detailed, step-by-step instructions for carrying out specific tasks (actionable execution).

---

## Layer 1: GenAI Security Policies

### Key Elements (13 Components)

#### 1. Goals

Align with organizational objectives + GenAI-specific challenges:
- Ensure **model integrity** (prevent poisoning, tampering)
- Maintain **data privacy** (PII protection, training data security)
- Foster **innovation** (balance security with development velocity)
- Comply with **AI-specific regulations** (EU AI Act, US EO 14110, etc.)

---

#### 2. Responsibilities

Define stakeholder roles:
- **Developers**: Secure model design, prompt sanitization
- **Data Scientists**: Training data quality, bias mitigation

---

#### 3. Structure

Robust + flexible to adapt:
- **Cross-functional teams**: Model design, data handling, security, compliance, risk management
- **Integration points**: MLOps, DevSecOps pipelines (see [[frameworks/llmops-framework]])

---

#### 4. Compliance

Detail relevant laws, standards, best practices:
- **Regulations**: GDPR (data privacy), EU AI Act (high-risk requirements), China CAC (content monitoring)
- **Standards**: ISO/IEC 42001 (AI management), NIST AI RMF, CSA CCM for GenAI (see [[frameworks/csa-ccm-genai-mapping]])
- **Best Practices**: OWASP Top 10 LLM (see [[frameworks/OWASP-top-10-LLM]]), MITRE ATLAS

---

#### 5. Risk Management

Address traditional + AI-unique risks:
- **Traditional**: Unauthorized access, data breaches, supply chain attacks
- **AI-Specific**: Model poisoning ([[techniques/data-poisoning-attacks]]), biased decision-making, prompt injection ([[techniques/prompt-injection]]), model extraction ([[techniques/model-extraction]])
- **Approach**: Regular risk assessments, mitigation strategies, ongoing monitoring

---

#### 6. Purpose

Articulate rationale:
- Secure GenAI assets against evolving threats
- Align AI practices with organizational values
- Meet ethical considerations + legal requirements
- Build stakeholder trust

---

#### 7. Scope & Applicability

Define coverage:
- **Models**: GPT-based, diffusion models, GANs, embeddings
- **Data Sources**: Training datasets, vector DBs, RAG corpora
- **Deployment Environments**: Cloud, on-prem, edge, hybrid
- **Stakeholders**: Internal developers, third-party vendors, end-users

---

#### 8. Objectives (CIA Triad for GenAI)

**Confidentiality**: Prevent unauthorized disclosure of:
- Proprietary training data, model weights, sensitive outputs
- Example: Healthcare GenAI leaking patient data

**Integrity**: Ensure accuracy/trustworthiness of:
- Models (no backdoors, tampering), data (no poisoning), outputs (no manipulation)
- Example: Financial forecasting model producing biased predictions

**Availability**: Guarantee authorized access:
- Uptime SLAs, resilience to denial-of-service attacks ([[techniques/agent-goal-hijack]])
- Example: Critical infrastructure AI unavailable during incident

---

#### 9. Enforcement

How compliance is ensured:
- **Monitoring**: Real-time anomaly detection, access logs, model behavior tracking
- **Auditing**: Periodic security assessments, penetration testing (see [[playbooks/llm-application-red-team]])
- **Reporting**: Incident escalation paths, compliance dashboards
- **Collaboration**: Technical + legal teams coordinate on violations

---

#### 10. Definitions

Clarify terminology:
- **GenAI**: Generative Artificial Intelligence (models creating new content: text, images, audio, video)
- **LLM**: Large Language Model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude)
- **RAG**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (see [[playbooks/rag-retrieval-assessment]])
- **Prompt Injection**: Malicious input manipulation (see [[techniques/prompt-injection]])
- **Model Poisoning**: Training data corruption (see [[techniques/data-poisoning-attacks]])

---

#### 11. Risk Appetite

Balance innovation vs. risk:
- **Risk-Averse**: High-stakes domains (healthcare, finance) → strict controls, limited model autonomy
- **Risk-Tolerant**: R&D, marketing → faster iteration, lighter oversight
- **Document Thresholds**: Define acceptable risk levels per use case

---

#### 12. Behavior (Rules for Personnel)

**Best Practices**:
- Model development: Adversarial training, input validation, output filtering
- Data handling: Anonymization, encryption, access segmentation (see [[mitigations/access-segmentation-and-rbac]])
- Security measures: MFA, least privilege, secrets management (see [[techniques/secrets-in-prompts-and-logs]])
- Ethical considerations: Bias testing, explainability, human-in-the-loop approvals

---

#### 13. Consequences

Penalties for non-compliance:
- **Minor Violations**: Retraining, access revocation (temporary)
- **Major Violations**: Termination, legal action, financial penalties
- **Example**: GSA interim policy → unauthorized GenAI use = up to termination

---

### Top 6 Policy Items (GSA Example)

**GSA Interim GenAI Policy** (effective until June 30, 2024):

1. **Prohibited Content**: No malicious, inappropriate, illegal, classified, or sensitive information generation
2. **Logging & Monitoring**: All LLM/GenAI usage logged by GSA
3. **Government-Controlled Devices Only**: No personal devices/cloud storage
4. **No Public Distribution**: GenAI-generated content prohibited for public use
5. **Mandatory Training**: Users must complete policy training
6. **Enforcement**: Violations → up to employment termination

> "GSA is an exception in defining security policy. Most organizations, especially small and medium organizations, are not well prepared to define the much needed security policy."

## Layer 2: GenAI Security Processes

### 1. Risk Management Processes

**GenAI-Specific Risks** (beyond traditional IT):

| Risk Category | Examples | Mitigation Process |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Poisoning** | Corrupted training data → biased outputs | Provenance tracking, data validation pipelines |
| **Model Theft** | API abuse, extraction attacks | Rate limiting, query monitoring, watermarking |
| **Prompt Injection** | Malicious prompts bypass safeguards | Input sanitization, dual-LLM judge, instruction hierarchy |
| **Adversarial Examples** | Inputs fool model at inference | Adversarial training, ensemble defenses |
| **Privacy Leakage** | Training data memorization, PII in outputs | Differential privacy, output filtering, data scrubbing |
| **Supply Chain** | Compromised pre-trained models | Model provenance, sandboxing, signed artifacts |

**Risk Assessment Workflow**:
1. **Identify Assets**: Models, training data, APIs, vector DBs
2. **Threat Modeling**: Use MITRE ATLAS (see resources below) + [[playbooks/cross-boundary-attack-chains|Cross-Boundary Attack Chains]]
3. **Vulnerability Scanning**: AVID, NIST NVD (AI-specific CVEs)
4. **Impact Analysis**: Classify by severity (critical/high/medium/low)
5. **Risk Prioritization**: Likelihood × Impact matrix
6. **Mitigation Planning**: Assign controls from [[mitigations/]]
7. **Continuous Monitoring**: Dashboards, alerting, periodic reassessment

---

### 2. Development Processes (LLMOps/DevSecOps)

**Secure AI Lifecycle** (see [[frameworks/llmops-framework]]):

**Phase 1: Data Collection & Preparation**
- Secure data sourcing (provenance tracking)

---

### 3. Access Governance Processes

**Key Controls**:

1. **Identity & Access Management (IAM)**
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) for model APIs, training data
   - Principle of least privilege (developers ≠ data scientists ≠ end-users)

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Required for sensitive model access (e.g., healthcare GenAI)

3. **Third-Party Vendor Management**
   - Due diligence reviews, contractual security terms
   - Limited access grants, activity monitoring
   - Example: Vendor enhancing model → restricted to necessary components only

---

## Layer 3: GenAI Security Procedures (Step-by-Step)

### A. Access Governance Procedures

#### 1. Authentication Procedure

**Objective**: Verify identities accessing sensitive AI assets.

**Steps**:
1. Implement MFA (password + hardware token / biometric)
2. Deploy SSO (Single Sign-On) for unified credential management
3. Enforce session timeouts for idle connections
4. Log all authentication attempts (success + failures)
5. Alert on anomalous login patterns (geographic, time-based)

**Example**: Healthcare generative model requires doctor authentication via password + secure key card (two-step verification for patient data access).

> "In a GenAI environment, where models might be deployed across various platforms and accessed by different devices, authentication ensures that only verified entities have access."
> 
> Source: [[sources/bibliography#Generative AI Security]], p. 113

---

#### 2. Access Management Procedure

**Objective**: Manage access control lists (ACLs) for training data, model APIs, outputs.

**Steps**:
1. Define access roles (developer, data scientist, auditor, end-user)
2. Create ACLs mapping roles → resources
3. Require management approval for access changes
4. Conduct quarterly access reviews (recertification)
5. Revoke access immediately upon role change/termination

**Example**: Financial forecasting model → only authorized analysts access sensitive data; changes require formal VP approval.

---

#### 3. Third-Party Security Procedure

**Objective**: Control external vendor/partner access to AI assets.

**Steps**:
1. **Due Diligence**: Security audit of vendor (SOC 2, ISO 27001 certification)
2. **Contractual Terms**: Define security responsibilities, liability, data handling
3. **Limited Access**: Grant minimum necessary permissions (sandbox environment)
4. **Monitoring**: Log vendor activities, flag anomalies
5. **Periodic Review**: Reassess vendor access quarterly

**Example**: Third-party vendor enhancing GenAI model → access limited to specific model components, monitored for unauthorized behavior, contractual security obligations.

---

### B. Operational Security Procedures

#### 1. Model Deployment Procedure

**Objective**: Secure transition of models to production.

**Steps**:
1. **Rigorous Testing**: Adversarial attack simulations, edge case validation
2. **Staging Environment**: Pre-production testing (isolated from prod data)
3. **Access Controls**: Role-based permissions for production APIs
4. **Monitoring & Logging**: Real-time anomaly detection, query logging
5. **Rollback Options**: Maintain previous stable model version for rapid revert

**Example**: Deploying personalized advertising content model → test against adversarial inputs, implement RBAC, monitor for abuse, prepare rollback if issues arise.

---

#### 2. Patch Management Procedure

**Objective**: Maintain security posture via timely updates.

**Steps**:
1. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Weekly scans of dependencies, libraries (check NIST NVD, AVID)
2. **Patch Testing**: Validate patches in non-prod environment
3. **Scheduling**: Apply updates during non-peak hours (maintenance windows)
4. **Documentation**: Log all patches applied (version, date, approver)
5. **Compliance Tracking**: Map patches to regulatory requirements

**Example**: GAN used for fashion design → regular updates to TensorFlow, PyTorch dependencies (tested in staging, scheduled weekends, documented for audits).

---

#### 3. Incident Response Procedure

**Objective**: Rapid detection, containment, recovery from AI-specific incidents.

**Steps**:
1. **Dedicated AI Incident Team**: Train on GenAI threats (prompt injection, model theft, data poisoning)
2. **Detection Tools**: SIEM integration, anomaly detection for model behavior
3. **Containment**: Isolate compromised models/data, throttle suspicious API access
4. **Eradication**: Remove malicious inputs, re-train models if poisoned
5. **Recovery**: Restore from clean backups, validate model integrity
6. **Post-Incident Analysis**: Root cause investigation, lessons learned, update playbooks

**Example**: Fraud detection system breach → incident team immediately contains access, investigates prompt injection vector, restores pre-compromise model, analyzes attack pattern to update defenses.

---

### C. Data Management Procedures

#### 1. Data Acquisition Procedure

**Objective**: Source and collect quality, compliant training data.

**Steps**:
1. **Data Sourcing**: Identify diverse, representative datasets (avoid bias)
2. **Legal Compliance**: Verify GDPR/CCPA consent, licensing agreements
3. **Data Validation**: Check integrity (remove duplicates, outliers)
4. **Documentation**: Record data provenance (source, collection date, licensing)

**Example**: Collecting facial images for realistic face generation → ensure diversity (age, ethnicity, gender), obtain explicit consent, comply with privacy laws.

---

#### 2. Data Labeling Procedure

**Objective**: Accurate categorization for supervised learning.

**Steps**:
1. **Automated Labeling**: Use pre-trained models for initial pass
2. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Expert review for ambiguous cases
3. **Bias Mitigation**: Audit labels for stereotypes, correct imbalances
4. **Quality Assurance**: Inter-rater reliability checks (multiple labelers per sample)

**Example**: Labeling handwritten digits for GAN training → automated preprocessing, human validation for unclear digits, audit for gender/race representation bias.

---

#### 3. Data Governance Procedure

**Objective**: Policies for appropriate data usage + protection.

**Steps**:
1. **Access Control**: RBAC for dataset access (see [[mitigations/access-segmentation-and-rbac]])
2. **Monitoring**: Audit logs for data access (who, when, what query)
3. **Ethical Guidelines**: Define prohibited uses (e.g., no surveillance without consent)
4. **Compliance Tracking**: Map data usage to regulations (GDPR Art. 5, Art. 6)

**Example**: Financial forecasting dataset → role-based access (analysts only), quarterly access reviews, prohibit non-forecasting use cases, monitor for unauthorized queries.

---

#### 4. Data Operations Procedure

**Objective**: Secure data transmission, storage, disposal.

**Steps**:
1. **Encryption**: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
2. **Backup & Redundancy**: Daily backups (3-2-1 rule: 3 copies, 2 media types, 1 offsite)
3. **Data Lifecycle Management**: Define retention policies, automate deletion after expiry
4. **Secure Disposal**: Cryptographic erasure, physical destruction (for on-prem media)

**Example**: Medical image data for 3D organ modeling → encrypted storage (FIPS 140-2 compliant), scheduled backups, secure deletion after project completion (HIPAA compliance).

## Governance Structures: Choosing the Right Model

### Option 1: Centralized GenAI Security Governance

**Description**: Single organization-wide entity manages all GenAI security policies, processes, procedures.

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Consistency**: Uniform policies across all product lines/business units
- ✅ **Efficient Decision-Making**: Cohesive, swift response to threats

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Rigidity**: Slow adaptation to product-specific needs
- ❌ **Bureaucratic Overhead**: May impede innovation pace

**Best For**: Small-to-medium orgs, highly regulated industries (finance, healthcare), initial GenAI adoption phase.

---

### Option 2: Semi-Centralized GenAI Security Governance

**Description**: Central authority develops policies; local champions implement + tailor for product/business unit needs.

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Empowers product-specific security champions
- ✅ **Decentralized Initiative**: Encourages innovation + responsiveness

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Coordination Challenges**: Requires careful balance (central vs. local)
- ❌ **Inconsistency Risk**: Potential for conflicting implementations
- ❌ **Shadow GenAI Risk**: May create unmonitored tools/models

**Best For**: Large orgs with diverse product lines, mature GenAI programs, orgs transitioning from centralized to decentralized.

---

### Option 3: Decentralized AI Security Governance

**Description**: Each product line/business unit manages its own AI security independently.

**Pros**:
- ✅ **Tailored Solutions**: Closely aligned with unique product needs
- ✅ **Nimbleness**: Quick local responses to threats/opportunities

**Cons**:
- ❌ **Lack of Standardization**: Inconsistent policies across org
- ❌ **Coordination Issues**: Difficult to align with overall org strategy
- ❌ **Shadow GenAI Certainty**: WILL create unmonitored tools/models

**Best For**: Highly autonomous business units, fast-moving startups, orgs with minimal regulatory constraints.

---

### Recommendation

**Start Centralized → Evolve to Semi-Centralized**:
- Begin with centralized model (establish baseline standards)
- Transition to semi-centralized as org matures (balance oversight + agility)
- Small/medium businesses: switch models dynamically based on GenAI mission evolution

> "We recommended starting with a centralized governance model and then moving to a semi-decentralized model for big organizations when starting a GenAI journey."
