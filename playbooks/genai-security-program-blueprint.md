# GenAI Security Program Blueprint

## Overview

Comprehensive playbook for building GenAI security programs covering policies, processes, procedures, and governance structures. Most organizations have not updated security policies, processes, and procedures for GenAI, leaving critical gaps in risk management.

A robust GenAI security program requires three layers:
1. **Policies** (high-level goals, compliance, risk appetite)
2. **Processes** (risk management, development lifecycle, access governance)
3. **Procedures** (step-by-step operational tasks)

Organizations must choose appropriate governance structures: centralized (consistency), semi-centralized (flexibility + oversight), or decentralized (tailored solutions).

> "Most companies have not yet updated their security policies, processes, and procedures in the new era of GenAI and have not instituted an effective security program to counter the risks generated by GenAI."

### 4. Governance Structure Recommendations

**Centralized Model**:
- **Best for**: Small-to-medium orgs, highly regulated industries, initial GenAI adoption
- **Pros**: Consistency, efficient decision-making
- **Cons**: Rigidity, bureaucratic overhead

**Semi-Centralized Model** (recommended for large orgs):
- **Best for**: Large orgs with diverse product lines, mature GenAI programs
- **Pros**: Flexibility, empowered local champions, innovation
- **Cons**: Coordination challenges, inconsistency risk

**Decentralized Model**:
- **Best for**: Highly autonomous business units, fast-moving startups
- **Pros**: Tailored solutions, nimbleness
- **Cons**: Lack of standardization, shadow GenAI certainty

**Recommended Approach**: Start centralized → evolve to semi-centralized as org matures
