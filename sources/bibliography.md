## Extraction Notes

When processing sources:
- Extract relevant sections to vault notes
- Link back to this bibliography with `[[sources/bibliography]]`
- Tag notes with `#source/<book-shortname>`
- Track page numbers for citations
- Create atomic notes for specific concepts

---

## Citation Format

When referencing sources in vault notes:

```markdown
> Content excerpt here.
> 
> Source: [[sources/bibliography#Book Title]], p. XX
```

---

## Next Steps

1. Parse PDFs to identify key sections relevant to:
   - MITRE ATLAS expansion
   - Methodology refinement
   - New techniques and case studies
   - Trust boundary controls
2. Create vault notes with proper citations
3. Update existing notes with sourced content
4. Build cross-references
