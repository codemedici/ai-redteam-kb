# Deployment / Governance Issues

This directory contains atomic, report-ready security issues specific to the Deployment / Governance trust boundary.

## What Belongs Here

Individual security issues that target operational and governance controls:
- Authentication and authorization bypass
- Rate limiting and abuse detection failures
- Multi-tenant isolation vulnerabilities
- CI/CD pipeline security gaps
- Monitoring and logging blind spots

Each issue page should be self-contained and follow the canonical template.

## How to Create a New Issue

1. Copy the structure from the Model issues template
2. Replace all placeholder text with specific content
3. Ensure all 11 required sections are present
4. Use framework IDs only (no prose) in the Framework References section
